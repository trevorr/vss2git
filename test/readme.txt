How to use the testing support

0. Install TortoiseSvn (latest version) and add its
   bin directory to the PATH (you might as well install
   another svn distro, but TortoiseSvn has got it all)

1. adapt the file passwd: add a username and a password
   (hint: you might have to type them very often...)

2. optional: if you desire to have another repo path than
   "/test/project", modify svn-init-repo.bat and
   svn-checkout-repo.bat accordingly

3. run all.bat to initialize the repo and the working set

4. if you want to reinitialize the test reop, goto step 3.
